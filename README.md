## About The Project

NewsTix will be a lightweight news aggregator website similar for example to Google News, where users will be able to follow the
news sources of their choice and according to their preferences (such as language, subject category, country and so on). 

This ongoing project leverages the important components and functionalities of the Spring Framework (such as Spring Data or
Spring Security) to register, authenticate and authorize users and serve them news articles from a vast, open Web API.

Next steps include introduction of site administrators (superusers) and a nice frontend.
